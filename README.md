# Race_assignment
The above are the main server side scripts that are being executed and are important for gameplay loop.
Apart from these there are other client side scripts that help pop up GUIs. 
Each code's commit comment will explain the function of the code. Apart from that there are also inline comments in code that help explain important line.
Debug print statements have not been removed as they help understand the code better.

To check full code directory and other important stuff like replicated storage, I have also uploaded the roblox editable file which when opened in roblox, gives you all scripts and models used.

Thank you.
